ScreenX
ScreenX is an AI-powered resume parser and screening tool built using Python. It utilizes the LLaMA 3 large language model (running locally via Ollama) to extract structured candidate data from resume PDFs and automatically uploads the extracted information to a Supabase database.

Features
Resume Parsing:

Upload a resume in PDF format.

Extract structured candidate data, including:

candidate_name

email

phone

skills (as a list)

experience (years)

highest_edu

role_applied

screened_on (timestamp)

AI-Powered Extraction:

Uses the locally hosted LLaMA 3 model via Ollama for smart data extraction instead of traditional regex or keyword methods.

Supabase Integration:

Automatically uploads parsed data to a Supabase table.

Fully compatible with PostgreSQL and RESTful API.

PDF Resume Support:

Leverages the pdfplumber library to extract text cleanly from PDF documents.

Simple CLI Workflow:

Just run the script and everything works from parsing to uploading â€” no need for a UI.

Technologies Used
Core:

Python 3

Ollama for running LLaMA 3 locally

Supabase for backend data storage

Libraries:

pdfplumber for reading PDF text

requests for Supabase API communication

Other Tools:

LLaMA 3 (8B) model (~4.7 GB) via Ollama

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Pip

Ollama (for running LLaMA 3)

A Supabase account + project setup
